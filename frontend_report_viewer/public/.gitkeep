# For static assets like images, fonts, and pre-generated JSON reports.

## Example: Pre-generated report

If you place a `CORE_vs_KNOTS_FIGHT_REPORT.json` file here, you could potentially fetch it directly in your components if it's small enough, or use Next.js API routes to serve it.

## Example: Chart Images

If charts are generated as static images and you want to serve them directly, they could also go here, though embedding them from the report artifact directly might be easier initially.
